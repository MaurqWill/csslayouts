            <p>The solar system is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The objects include eight planets, dozens of moons, and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. The planets are divided into four terrestrial planets, two gas giants, and two ice giants. The solar system also extends beyond the planets to the Kuiper Belt and the heliopause, which mark the edge of the solar system.</p>

            <h3>A Vast Exploration</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Galaxies are sprawling systems of dust, gas, dark matter, and anywhere from a million to a trillion stars that are held together by gravity. Nearly all large galaxies are thought to also contain supermassive black holes at their centers. In our own galaxy, the Milky Way, the sun is just one of about 100 to 400 billion stars that spin around Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole that contains as much mass as four million suns.</p>
